Day01stats


statistics:- is a branch of mathematics where we can,collect,organize, visualise , analyse  the data for
better decision making and future predictions

There 2 types of stats

1.Descriptive stats:- gives the summary of data

2.inferential stats:- is a process of data analysis where we can make the conclusion report about your
data


#what is a population?

#population is a overall data that you want draw conclusion

#what is sample?

#sample is a part of population

#what is data?

#data is facts or piece of information that can be measured 


Types of sampling techniques:-

1.simple random sampling:-  is process of sampling where every member has equal chance to get
selected 





2.stratified sampling:- is process where population splits in to non overlapping groups.










3.systametic sampling:-  is a probability sampling methods  where researchers select population  of nth
intervel







4. convinence sampling:- is the process of taking the sample data from those who has knowledge on the
reasearch data



#Variable:- are containers where we can store the data and reuse it 


the variable are 2 types according to stats


Quantitative variable:-  numerical data--> 2types --

a. continuous data:-   a numeric value that has infinite number of values 

ex:- weight of students in a class room

       height of students in a class room


b. discrete data:-  a fixed whole number

ex:-  no of childrens in a family ---> 2,3,4,

        Total population in a city


No of students in a class--> discrete data

House rent prices in a area---> continous

No of houses in a area-->discrete

count of sugar--->cont




Qualitative variable:- is categorical data based on some characterstics we derive some values 

        ex:- dog breeds, eye color, gender,level of education,marital status



#what are all variable measurment sclaes do we have?

#there are 4 types

#1.Nominal data:- categorical data and no order

#2.ordinal data:- order matters

#3.intervel:-    order matters also values also matter

#4.ratio:- 1:2.3:2

np.where(condition,true,fals)

q)compute the indices of an array where the condition is true-->np.argwhere(condition)

pandas fillna-->

df[‘col’].fillna(methods=’ffil’,how,any)
